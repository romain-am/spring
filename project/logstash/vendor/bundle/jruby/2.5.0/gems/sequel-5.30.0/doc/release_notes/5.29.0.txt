= New Features

* An empty_failure_backtraces plugin has been added for using empty
  backtraces for ValidationFailed and HookFailed exceptions. In many
  cases, these exceptions are automatically handled (e.g. web form
  submission handling to display appropriate error pages), and using
  empty backtraces is 10-15x faster on JRuby 9.2.7.0+.

* Dataset#json_serializer_opts has been added to the json_serializer
  plugin.  This allows setting default options on a per-Dataset basis
  for all Dataset#to_json calls.

= Other Improvements

* Another disconnect error is now recognized in the tinytds adapter.

* Using Sequel with the the CRuby master branch (what will be Ruby 3)
  now works by supporting a second argument for
  Dataset#initialize_clone.

* Sequel now avoids a warning in verbose mode when using the postgres
  adapter, a recent version of ruby-pg, and bound variables.

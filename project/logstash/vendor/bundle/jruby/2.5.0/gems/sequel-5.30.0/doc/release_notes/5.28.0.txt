= New Features

* An any_not_empty extension has been added, for making Dataset#any?
  without a block be the same as !empty?.  This can result in a
  much faster database query.

* An exclude_or_null extension has been added, adding a
  Dataset#exclude_or_null method that returns rows where the given
  expression is false or NULL.  This extension is supported on
  PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL, H2, and HSQLDB.

= Other Improvements

* When using the jdbc/postgresql adapter, calling with_fetch_size
  on a dataset will emit a warning.  This is because the driver
  will ignore the setting.

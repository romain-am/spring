= New Features

* Sequel now supports generated columns on SQLite 3.31+ using the
  :generated_always_as and :generated_type options. Example:

    DB.create_table(:table) do
      primary_key :id
      Numeric :amount, null: false
      Numeric :tax, null: false
      Numeric :total, generated_always_as: (Sequel[:amount] + :tax)
    end

= Other Improvements

* The Database#transaction :before_retry option is now called before
  retrying the transaction even when the :num_retries option is set
  to nil.

* The gem no longer ships with specs and older release notes, reducing
  the gem size by over 40%.

Any packets that have not failed either of the two

The value of the packet status is a sum.  This sum
initially takes the value zero.  Then, for each
error, E, that has been discovered in this packet,
2 raised to a value representing E is added to the sum.
The errors and the bits that represent them are
dependent on the media type of the interface that
this channel is receiving packets from.

The errors defined for a packet captured off of an
Ethernet interface are as follows:

    bit #    Error
        0    Packet is longer than 1518 octets
        1    Packet is shorter than 64 octets
        2    Packet experienced a CRC or Alignment
             error

For example, an Ethernet fragment would have a
value of 6 (2^1 + 2^2).

As this MIB is expanded to new media types, this
object will have other media-specific errors defined.

For the purposes of this status matching algorithm, if
the packet status is longer than this
object, filterPktStatus this object is conceptually

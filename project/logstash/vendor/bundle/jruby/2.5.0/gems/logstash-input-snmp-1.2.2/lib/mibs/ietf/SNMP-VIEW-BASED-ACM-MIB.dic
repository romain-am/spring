Each entry is indexed by a groupName, a contextPrefix,
a securityModel and a securityLevel.  To determine
whether access is allowed, one entry from this table
needs to be selected and the proper viewName from that
entry must be used for access control checking.

To select the proper entry, follow these steps:

1) the set of possible matches is formed by the
   intersection of the following sets of entries:

     the set of entries with identical vacmGroupName
     the union of these two sets:
      - the set with identical vacmAccessContextPrefix
      - the set of entries with vacmAccessContextMatch
        value of 'prefix' and matching
        vacmAccessContextPrefix
     intersected with the union of these two sets:
      - the set of entries with identical
        vacmSecurityModel
      - the set of entries with vacmSecurityModel
        value of 'any'
     intersected with the set of entries with
     vacmAccessSecurityLevel value less than or equal
     to the requested securityLevel



2) if this set has only one member, we're done
   otherwise, it comes down to deciding how to weight
   the preferences between ContextPrefixes,
   SecurityModels, and SecurityLevels as follows:
   a) if the subset of entries with securityModel
      matching the securityModel in the message is
      not empty, then discard the rest.
   b) if the subset of entries with
      vacmAccessContextPrefix matching the contextName
      in the message is not empty,
      then discard the rest
   c) discard all entries with ContextPrefixes shorter
      than the longest one remaining in the set

groups are really equivalent since the assumption that
the securityName has been authenticated does not hold.""",

within MIB views.

Each MIB view is defined by two sets of view subtrees:
  - the included view subtrees, and
  - the excluded view subtrees.
Every such view subtree, both the included and the



excluded ones, is defined in this table.

To determine if a particular object instance is in
a particular MIB view, compare the object instance's
OBJECT IDENTIFIER with each of the MIB view's active
entries in this table.  If none match, then the
object instance is not in the MIB view.  If one or
more match, then the object instance is included in,
or excluded from, the MIB view according to the
value of vacmViewTreeFamilyType in the entry whose
value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree has the most
sub-identifiers.  If multiple entries match and have
the same number of sub-identifiers (when wildcarding
is specified with the value of vacmViewTreeFamilyMask),
then the lexicographically greatest instance of
vacmViewTreeFamilyType determines the inclusion or
exclusion.

An object instance's OBJECT IDENTIFIER X matches an
active entry in this table when the number of
sub-identifiers in X is at least as many as in the
value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree for the entry,
and each sub-identifier in the value of
vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree matches its corresponding
sub-identifier in X.  Two sub-identifiers match
either if the corresponding bit of the value of
vacmViewTreeFamilyMask for the entry is zero (the
'wild card' value), or if they are equal.

A 'family' of subtrees is the set of subtrees defined
by a particular combination of values of
vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree and vacmViewTreeFamilyMask.

In the case where no 'wild card' is defined in the
vacmViewTreeFamilyMask, the family of subtrees reduces
to a single subtree.

When creating or changing MIB views, an SNMP Command
Generator application should utilize the
vacmViewSpinLock to try to avoid collisions.  See
DESCRIPTION clause of vacmViewSpinLock.

When creating MIB views, it is strongly advised that
first the 'excluded' vacmViewTreeFamilyEntries are
created and then the 'included' entries.

When deleting MIB views, it is strongly advised that
first the 'included' vacmViewTreeFamilyEntries are



deleted and then the 'excluded' entries.

                """The bit mask which, in combination with the
corresponding instance of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree,
defines a family of view subtrees.

Each bit of this bit mask corresponds to a
sub-identifier of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree, with the
most significant bit of the i-th octet of this octet
string value (extended if necessary, see below)
corresponding to the (8*i - 7)-th sub-identifier, and
the least significant bit of the i-th octet of this
octet string corresponding to the (8*i)-th
sub-identifier, where i is in the range 1 through 16.

Each bit of this bit mask specifies whether or not
the corresponding sub-identifiers must match when
determining if an OBJECT IDENTIFIER is in this
family of view subtrees; a '1' indicates that an
exact match must occur; a '0' indicates 'wild card',
i.e., any sub-identifier value matches.

Thus, the OBJECT IDENTIFIER X of an object instance
is contained in a family of view subtrees if, for
each sub-identifier of the value of
vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree, either:

  the i-th bit of vacmViewTreeFamilyMask is 0, or

  the i-th sub-identifier of X is equal to the i-th
  sub-identifier of the value of
  vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree.

If the value of this bit mask is M bits long and



there are more than M sub-identifiers in the
corresponding instance of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree,
then the bit mask is extended with 1's to be the
required length.

Note that when the value of this object is the
zero-length string, this extension rule results in
a mask of all-1's being used (i.e., no 'wild card'),
and the family of view subtrees is the one view
subtree uniquely identified by the corresponding
instance of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree.

Note that masks of length greater than zero length
do not need to be supported.  In this case this
object is made read-only.""",

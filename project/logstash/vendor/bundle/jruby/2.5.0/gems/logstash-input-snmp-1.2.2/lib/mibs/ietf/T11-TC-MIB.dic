index value to identify a particular Fabric within
one (or more) physical infrastructures.

In an environment that is conformant to FC-SW-3, where



there is always exactly one Fabric in a single physical
infrastructure, the value of this Fabric Index will
always be 1.

However, the current standard, FC-SW-4, defines
how multiple Fabrics, each with its own management
instrumentation, could operate within one (or more)
physical infrastructures.  When such multiple Fabrics
are in use, this index value is used to uniquely
identify a particular Fabric within a physical
infrastructure.

Note that the value of this textual convention has a
range of (0..4095) so as to be consistent with FC-SW-4,
which says that a 'VF_ID Bitmap' is 512 bytes long, with
the high-order bit representing VF_ID zero, and the
low-order bit representing 4095.""",

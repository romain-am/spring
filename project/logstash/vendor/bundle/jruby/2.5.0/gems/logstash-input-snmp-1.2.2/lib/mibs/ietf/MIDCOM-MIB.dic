            """This MIB module defines a set of basic objects for
configuring middleboxes, such as firewalls and network



address translators, in order to enable communication
across these devices.

Managed objects defined in this MIB module are structured
in three kinds of objects:
  - transaction objects required according to the MIDCOM
    protocol requirements defined in RFC 3304 and according
    to the MIDCOM protocol semantics defined in RFC 3989,
  - configuration objects that can be used for retrieving or
    setting parameters of the implementation of transaction
    objects,
  - optional monitoring objects that provide information
    about used resource and statistics

The transaction objects are organized in two subtrees:
  - objects modeling MIDCOM policy rules in the
    midcomRuleTable
  - objects modeling MIDCOM policy rule groups in the
    midcomGroupTable

Note that typically, configuration objects are not intended
to be written by MIDCOM clients.  In general, write access
to these objects needs to be restricted more strictly than
write access to objects in the transaction subtrees.

the policy rule.  See the definition of midcomRuleOperStatus
for a description of the values.

When a midcomRuleEntry is created without explicitly setting
this object, its value will be notSet(3).

However, a SET request can only set this object to either
reserve(1) or enable(2).  Attempts to set this object to
notSet(3) will always fail with an 'inconsistentValue'
error.  Note that this error code is SNMP specific.  If the
MIB module is used with other protocols than SNMP, errors
with similar semantics specific to those protocols should
be returned.

When the midcomRuleAdminStatus object is set, then the
MIDCOM-MIB implementation will try to read the respective
relevant objects of the entry and try to achieve the
corresponding midcomRuleOperStatus.

Setting midcomRuleAdminStatus to value reserve(1) when
object midcomRuleOperStatus has a value of reserved(7)
does not have any effect on the policy rule.
Setting midcomRuleAdminStatus to value enable(2) when
object midcomRuleOperStatus has a value of enabled(8)
does not have any effect on the policy rule.

Depending on whether the midcomRuleAdminStatus is set to
reserve(1) or enable(2), several objects must be set in
advance.  They serve as parameters of the policy rule to be
established.




When object midcomRuleAdminStatus is set to reserve(1),
then the following objects in the same entry are of
relevance:
    - midcomRuleInterface
    - midcomRuleTransportProtocol
    - midcomRulePortRange
    - midcomRuleInternalIpVersion
    - midcomRuleExternalIpVersion
    - midcomRuleInternalIpAddr
    - midcomRuleInternalIpPrefixLength
    - midcomRuleInternalPort
    - midcomRuleLifetime

MIDCOM-MIB implementation may also consider the value
of object midcomRuleMaxIdleTime when establishing
a reserve rule.

When object midcomRuleAdminStatus is set to enable(2),
then the following objects in the same entry are of
relevance:
    - midcomRuleInterface
    - midcomRuleFlowDirection
    - midcomRuleMaxIdleTime
    - midcomRuleTransportProtocol
    - midcomRulePortRange
    - midcomRuleInternalIpVersion
    - midcomRuleExternalIpVersion
    - midcomRuleInternalIpAddr
    - midcomRuleInternalIpPrefixLength
    - midcomRuleInternalPort
    - midcomRuleExternalIpAddr
    - midcomRuleExternalIpPrefixLength
    - midcomRuleExternalPort
    - midcomRuleLifetime

notSet(3).""",

  this object will change to either requestRejected(6),
  reserved(7), or enabled(8) without any external
  interaction.  A MIDCOM-MIB implementation MAY return
  this value while processing a request.

- requestRejected(6) indicates that a request to establish



  a policy rule specified by the entry was rejected.  The
  reason for rejection is indicated by the value of
  midcomRuleError.

- reserved(7) indicates that the entry describes an
  established policy reserve rule.
  These values of MidcomRuleEntry are meaningful
  for a reserved policy rule:
      - midcomRuleMaxIdleTime
      - midcomRuleInterface
      - midcomRuleTransportProtocol
      - midcomRulePortRange
      - midcomRuleInternalIpVersion

      - midcomRuleInternalPort
      - midcomRuleOutsideIpAddr
      - midcomRuleOutsidePort
      - midcomRuleLifetime

- enabled(8) indicates that the entry describes an
  established policy enable rule.
  These values of MidcomRuleEntry are meaningful
  for an enabled policy rule:

      - midcomRuleFlowDirection
      - midcomRuleInterface
      - midcomRuleMaxIdleTime
      - midcomRuleTransportProtocol
      - midcomRulePortRange
      - midcomRuleInternalIpVersion

      - midcomRuleInsidePort
      - midcomRuleOutsideIpAddr
      - midcomRuleOutsidePort
      - midcomRuleLifetime

- timedOut(9) indicates that the lifetime of a previously
  established policy rule has expired and that the policy
  rule is terminated for this reason.



- terminatedOnRequest(10) indicates that a previously
  established policy rule was terminated by an SNMP
  manager setting the midcomRuleLifetime to 0 or
  setting midcomGroupLifetime to 0.

- terminated(11) indicates that a previously established
  policy rule was terminated by the MIDCOM-MIB
  implementation for a reason other than lifetime
  expiration or an explicit request from a MIDCOM client.

- genericError(12) indicates that the policy rule
  specified by the entry is not established due to
  an error condition not listed above.

The states timedOut(9), terminatedOnRequest(10), and
terminated(11) are referred to as termination states.

The states incorrectRequest(4), requestRejected(6),
and genericError(12) are referred to as error states.

The checkingRequest(3) and processingRequest(5)
states are transient states, which will lead to either
one of the error states or the reserved(7) state or the
enabled(8) state.  MIDCOM-MIB implementations MAY return
these values when checking or processing requests.""",

This object is used as input to a request for establishing
a policy rule as well as for indicating the properties of
an established policy rule.

If object midcomRuleOperStatus of the same entry has a

object can be written by a manager in order to specify
the requested lifetime of a policy rule to be established.

If object midcomRuleOperStatus of the same entry has a

object indicates the (continuously decreasing) remaining
lifetime of the established policy rule.  Note that when
entering state reserved(7) or enabled(8), the MIDCOM-MIB
implementation can choose a lifetime shorter than the one
requested.

Unlike other parameters of the policy rule, this parameter
can still be written in state reserved(7) and enabled(8).



Writing to this object is processed by the MIDCOM-MIB
implementation by choosing a lifetime value that is
greater than 0 and less than or equal to the minimum of
the requested value and the value specified by object
midcomConfigMaxLifetime:

 0 <= lt_granted <= MINIMUM(lt_requested, lt_maximum)

where:
   - lt_granted is the actually granted lifetime by the

   - lt_requested is the requested lifetime of the MIDCOM
     client
   - lt_maximum is the value of object
     midcomConfigMaxLifetime

SNMP SET requests to this object may be rejected or the
value of the object after an accepted SET operation may be
less than the value that was contained in the SNMP SET
request.

Successfully writing a value of 0 terminates the policy
rule.  Note that after a policy rule is terminated, still
the entry will exist as long as indicated by the value of
midcomRuleStorageTime.

newEntry(1), setting(2), reserved(7), or enabled(7)

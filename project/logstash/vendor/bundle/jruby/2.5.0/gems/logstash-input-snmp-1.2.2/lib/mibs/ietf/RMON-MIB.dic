                    """Bug fixes, clarifications and minor changes based on
implementation experience, published as RFC1757 [18].

Two changes were made to object definitions:

1) A new status bit has been defined for the
captureBufferPacketStatus object, indicating that the
packet order within the capture buffer may not be identical to
the packet order as received off the wire.  This bit may only
be used for packets transmitted by the probe.  Older NMS
applications can safely ignore this status bit, which might be
used by newer agents.

2) The packetMatch trap has been removed.  This trap was never
actually 'approved' and was not added to this document along
with the risingAlarm and fallingAlarm traps. The packetMatch
trap could not be throttled, which could cause disruption of
normal network traffic under some circumstances. An NMS should
configure a risingAlarm threshold on the appropriate
channelMatches instance if a trap is desired for a packetMatch
event. Note that logging of packetMatch events is still
supported--only trap generation for such events has been
removed.

In addition, several clarifications to individual object
definitions have been added to assist agent and NMS
implementors:

- global definition of 'good packets' and 'bad packets'

- more detailed text governing conceptual row creation and
  modification

- instructions for probes relating to interface changes and
  disruptions

- clarification of some ethernet counter definitions

- recommended formula for calculating network utilization

- clarification of channel and captureBuffer behavior for some
  unusual conditions

- examples of proper instance naming for each table""",

                """The status of a table entry.

Setting this object to the value invalid(4) has the
effect of invalidating the corresponding entry.
That is, it effectively disassociates the mapping
identified with said entry.
It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether
the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table.
Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to
receive tabular information from agents that corresponds
to entries currently not in use.  Proper
interpretation of such entries requires examination
of the relevant EntryStatus object.

An existing instance of this object cannot be set to
createRequest(2).  This object may only be set to
createRequest(2) when this instance is created.  When
this object is created, the agent may wish to create
supplemental object instances with default values
to complete a conceptual row in this table.  Because the
creation of these default objects is entirely at the option
of the agent, the manager must not assume that any will be
created, but may make use of any that are created.
Immediately after completing the create operation, the agent
must set this object to underCreation(3).

When in the underCreation(3) state, an entry is allowed to
exist in a possibly incomplete, possibly inconsistent state,
usually to allow it to be modified in multiple PDUs.  When in
this state, an entry is not fully active.
Entries shall exist in the underCreation(3) state until
the management station is finished configuring the entry
and sets this object to valid(1) or aborts, setting this
object to invalid(4).  If the agent determines that an
entry has been in the underCreation(3) state for an
abnormally long time, it may decide that the management
station has crashed.  If the agent makes this decision,
it may set this object to invalid(4) to reclaim the
entry.  A prudent agent will understand that the
management station may need to wait for human input
and will allow for that possibility in its
determination of this abnormally long period.

An entry in the valid(1) state is fully configured and
consistent and fully represents the configuration or
operation such a row is intended to represent.  For
example, it could be a statistical function that is
configured and active, or a filter that is available
in the list of filters processed by the packet capture
process.

A manager is restricted to changing the state of an entry in
the following ways:

     To:       valid  createRequest  underCreation  invalid
From:
valid             OK             NO             OK       OK
createRequest    N/A            N/A            N/A      N/A
underCreation     OK             NO             OK       OK
invalid           NO             NO             NO       OK
nonExistent       NO             OK             NO       OK

In the table above, it is not applicable to move the state
from the createRequest state to any other state because the
manager will never find the variable in that state.  The
nonExistent state is not a value of the enumeration, rather
it means that the entryStatus variable does not exist at all.
An agent may allow an entryStatus variable to change state in
additional ways, so long as the semantics of the states are
followed.  This allowance is made to ease the implementation of
the agent and is made despite the fact that managers should
never exercise these additional state transitions.""",

The value returned will depend on the location of the

10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a
station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if
three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously.  A
repeater port must detect a collision when two or more
stations are transmitting simultaneously.  Thus a probe
placed on a repeater port could record more collisions
than a probe connected to a station on the same segment
would.

Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering
10BASE-T.  14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3
defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals
on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving
at the same time).  A 10BASE-T station can only detect
collisions when it is transmitting.  Thus probes placed on
a station and a repeater, should report the same number of
collisions.

Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should
ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or
more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE
802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax
segments to which the repeater is connected.""",

3600 (1 hour).

Because the counters in a bucket may overflow at their
maximum value with no indication, a prudent manager will
take into account the possibility of overflow in any of
the associated counters.  It is important to consider the
minimum time in which any counter could overflow on a
particular media type and set the historyControlInterval
object to a value less than this interval.  This is
typically most important for the 'octets' counter in any
media-specific table.  For example, on an Ethernet
network, the etherHistoryOctets counter could overflow
in about one hour at the Ethernet's maximum
utilization.

historyControlStatus object is equal to valid(1).""",

10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a
station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if
three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously.  A
repeater port must detect a collision when two or more
stations are transmitting simultaneously.  Thus a probe
placed on a repeater port could record more collisions

Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering

defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals
on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving
at the same time).  A 10BASE-T station can only detect
collisions when it is transmitting.  Thus probes placed on
a station and a repeater, should report the same number of
collisions.

initially takes the value zero.  Then, for each
error, E, that has been discovered in this packet,
2 raised to a value representing E is added to the sum.
The errors and the bits that represent them are dependent
on the media type of the interface that this channel
is receiving packets from.

Ethernet interface are as follows:

    bit #    Error
        0    Packet is longer than 1518 octets
        1    Packet is shorter than 64 octets
        2    Packet experienced a CRC or Alignment error

For example, an Ethernet fragment would have a
value of 6 (2^1 + 2^2).

As this MIB is expanded to new media types, this object
will have other media-specific errors defined.

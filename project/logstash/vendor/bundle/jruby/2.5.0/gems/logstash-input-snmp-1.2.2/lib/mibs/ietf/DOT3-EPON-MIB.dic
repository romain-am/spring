The 'Queue report' field reports the occupancy of each
uplink transmission queue.
The number of queue sets defines the number of the
reported sets, as would be explained in the description
of the dot3ExtPkgQueueSetsTable table.  For each set the
report bitmap defines which queue is present in the
report, meaning that although the MPCP REPORT message
can report up to 8 queues in a REPORT message, the
actual number is flexible.  The Queue table has a
variable size that is limited by the
dot3ExtPkgObjectReportMaximumNumQueues object, as an
ONU can have fewer queues to report.
The entries in the table are control and status
indication objects for managing the queues of an EPON
interface that are gathered in an extended package as
an addition to the objects that are based on the
[802.3ah] attributes.
Each object has a row for every virtual link and for
every queue in the report.
The LLID field, as defined in the [802.3ah], is a 2-byte
register (15-bit field and a broadcast bit) limiting the



number of virtual links to 32768.  Typically the number
of expected virtual links in a PON is like the number of
ONUs, which is 32-64, plus an additional entry for
broadcast LLID (with a value of 0xffff).
The number of queues is between 0 and 7 and limited by
dot3ExtPkgObjectReportMaximumNumQueues.""",

duplicating existing management objects of bridging

dedicated transmit queuing mechanism is implied in the

As can be seen from the message format, the ONU
interface reports of the status of up to 8 queues



and it can report in a single MPCP REPORT message
of a few sets of queues.
The number of queue_sets defines the number of the
reported sets, and it can reach a value of up to 8.
It means that an ONU can hold a variable number of
sets between 0 and 7.
The dot3ExtPkgQueueSetsTable table has a variable
queue_set size that is limited by the
dot3ExtPkgObjectReportMaximumNumThreshold object as an
ONU can have fewer queue_sets to report.
The 'Queue report' field reports the occupancy of each
uplink transmission queue.  The queue_sets can be used to
report the occupancy of the queues in a few levels as to
allow granting, in an accurate manner, of only part of
the data available in the queues.  A Threshold is
defined for each queue_set to define the level of the
queue that is counted for the report of the occupancy.
The threshold is reflected in the queue_set table by the
dot3ExtPkgObjectReportThreshold object.
For each queue set, the report bitmap defines which
queues are present in the report, meaning that
although the MPCP REPORT message can report of up to 8
queues in a REPORT message, the actual number is
flexible.
The dot3ExtPkgQueueSetsTable table has a variable queue
size that is limited by the
dot3ExtPkgObjectReportMaximumNumQueues object as an ONU
can have fewer queues to report.
Each object has a row for every virtual link, for each
queue in the report and for each queue_set in the queue.
The LLID field, as defined in the [802.3ah], is a 2-byte
register (15-bit field and a broadcast bit) limiting the
number of virtual links to 32768.  Typically the number
of expected virtual links in a PON is like the number of
ONUs, which is 32-64, plus an additional entry for
broadcast LLID (with a value of 0xffff).
The number of queues is between 0 and 7 and limited by
dot3ExtPkgObjectReportMaximumNumQueues.
The number of queues_sets is between 0 and 7 and limited
by dot3ExtPkgObjectReportMaximumNumThreshold.""",

            """The Event Notification MIB is an extension of the
CABLE DEVICE MIB.  It defines various notification
objects for both cable modem and cable modem termination
systems.  Two groups of SNMP notification objects are
defined.  One group is for notifying cable modem events,
and one group is for notifying cable modem termination
system events.

DOCSIS defines numerous events, and each event is
assigned to a functional category.  This MIB defines
a notification object for each functional category.
The varbinding list of each notification includes
information about the event that occurred on the
device.

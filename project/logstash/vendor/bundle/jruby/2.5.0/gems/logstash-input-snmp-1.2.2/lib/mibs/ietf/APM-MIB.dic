All objects of type AppLocalIndex are assigned by the agent
out of a common number space. In other words, AppLocalIndex
values assigned to entries in one table must not overlap with
AppLocalIndex values assigned to entries in another
table. Further, every protocolDirLocalIndex value registered
by the agent automatically assigns the same value out of the



AppLocalIndex number space.

For example, if the protocolDirLocalIndex values { 1, 3, 5, 7 }
have been assigned, and the apmHttpFilterAppLocalIndex values
{ 6, 8, 9 } have been assigned:

    - Assignment of new AppLocalIndex values must not use the
      values { 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 }.
    - AppLocalIndex values { 1, 3, 5, 7 } are automatically
      assigned and are associated with the identical value of
      protocolDirLocalIndex. In particular, an entry in the
      apmAppDirTable indexed by a value provides further
      information about a protocol indexed by the same value
      in the protocolDirTable of RMON2.

The value for each supported application must remain constant
at least from one re-initialization of the entity's network
management system to the next re-initialization, except that
if an application is deleted and re-created, it must be
re-created with a new value that has not been used since the
last re-initialization.

entity. An AppLocalIndex value must not be re-used until the

The metrics for a single transaction are the responsiveness of
the transaction and whether the transaction succeeded (a
boolean). When such metrics are aggregated in this MIB Module,
these metrics are replaced by averages and distributions of
responsiveness and availability. The metrics describing
aggregates are constant no matter which type of aggregation is
being performed. These metrics may be found in the
apmReportTable.

The flows(1) aggregation is the simplest. All transactions
that share common application/server/client 3-tuples are
aggregated together, resulting in a set of metrics for all
such unique 3-tuples.

The clients(2) aggregation results in somewhat more
aggregation (i.e., fewer resulting records). All transactions
that share common application/client tuples are aggregated
together, resulting in a set of metrics for all such unique
tuples.

The servers(3) aggregation usually results in still more
aggregation (i.e., fewer resulting records). All transactions
that share common application/server tuples are aggregated
together, resulting in a set of metrics for all such unique
tuples.

The applications(4) aggregation results in the most
aggregation (i.e., the fewest resulting records). All
transactions that share a common application are aggregated
together, resulting in a set of metrics for all such unique
applications.

Note that it is not meaningful to aggregate applications, as
different applications have widely varying characteristics. As a
result, this set of aggregations is complete.""",

corresponding entries to this table.

application performance measurement for this application.
There are 3 types of measurements for different types of
applications:

Transaction-Oriented applications have a fairly constant
workload to perform for all transactions. The responsiveness
metric for transaction-oriented applications is application
response time (from first request to final delivery of
service) and is measured in milliseconds. This is
commonly referred to as end-user response time.

Throughput-Oriented applications have widely varying workloads
based on the nature of the client request. In particular,
throughput-oriented applications vary widely in the amount of
data that must be transported to satisfy the request. The
responsiveness metric for throughput-oriented applications is
kilobits per second.

Streaming-Oriented applications deliver data at a constant
metered rate of speed regardless of the responsiveness of the
networking and computing infrastructure. This constant rate of
speed is generally specified to be below (sometimes well
below) the nominal capability of the infrastructure. However,
when the infrastructures cannot deliver data at this speed,
interruption of service or degradation of service can
result. The responsiveness metric for streaming-oriented
applications is the ratio of time that the service is degraded
or interrupted to the total service time. This metric is
measured in parts per million.

Note that for some applications, measuring more than one
responsiveness type may be interesting. For agents that wish



to support more than one measurement for a application, they
will populate this table with multiple entries for that
application, one for each type.""",

directory information when the directory is set to a known
(usually fixed) configuration.

If the value of this object isn't 0.0, it signifies
that the entire contents of the apmAppDirTable,
apmHttpFilterTable, apmUserDefinedAppTable and
protocolDirTable are equal to a known state identified
by the value of this object. If a manager recognizes this
value as identifying a directory configuration it has a local
copy of, it may use this local copy rather than downloading
these tables. Note that it may have downloaded this local copy
(and the ID) from another agent and used this copy for all
other agents that advertised the same ID.

If an agent recognizes that the entire contents of the
apmAppDirTable, apmHttpFilterTable,
apmUserDefinedAppTable and protocolDirTable are equal to
a known state to which an ID has been assigned, it should set
this object to that ID.

In many cases when this feature is used, the application
directory information will be in read-only memory and thus the
tables may not be modified via SNMP requests. In the event



that the tables are writable and a modification is made, the
agent is responsible for setting this object to 0.0 if it
cannot determine that the state is equal to a known state.

An agent is not obligated to recognize and advertise all such
registered states as it may not have knowledge of all states.
Thus, a manager may encounter agents whose DirectoryID value
is 0.0 even though the contents of the directory were equal to
a registered state.

Note that the contents of those tables includes the
protocolDirLocalIndex and appLocalIndex values. In other
words, these values can't be assigned randomly on each agent,
but must be equal to values that are part of the known
state. While it is possible for a manager to download
application directory details using SNMP and to set the
appropriate directoryID, the manager would need to have some
scheme to ensure consistent values of LocalIndex variables
from agent to agent. Such schemes are outside the scope of
this specification.

Application directory registrations are unique within an
administrative domain.

Typically these registrations will be made by an agent
software developer who will set the application directory
tables to a read-only state and assign a DirectoryID to that
state. Thus, all agents running this software would share the
same DirectoryID. As the application directory might change
from one software release to the next, the developer may
register different DirectoryID's for each software release.

A customer could also create a site-wide application directory
configuration and assign a DirectoryID to that configuration
as long as consistent values of LocalIndex variables can be
ensured.

of monitoring. The apmNameTable assigns a long-lived
identifier to a client and records what addresses were
assigned to that client for periods of time. Various
implementation techniques exist for tracking this mapping but
if an agent is unable to track client address mappings, it may
map client identifiers to client addresses rather than to
distinct client machines.

A particular apmNameClientID should be a constant attribute of
a particular client. When available, the agent may also record
the machine name and/or user name which may be valuable for
displaying to humans. The apmNameMachineName and
apmNameUserName are relatively constant, changing only if
these attributes actually change on the client.

The agent will store a historical log of these entries, aging
out old entries as the log becomes too large. Since this table
contains information vital to the interpretation of other
tables (e.g., the apmReportTable), the agent should ensure that



the log doesn't age out entries that would be referenced by
data in those tables.

Note that an entry for a clientID is active from its
StartTime until the StartTime of another entry (for the same
clientID) that supersedes it, or 'now' if none supersede
it. Therefore, if a clientID only has a single entry, it is by
definition very new and should never be aged out. No entry for
a clientID should be aged out unless it has been updated by a
new entry for the client (i.e., with an updated address) and
only if the new entry is 'old' enough.

To determine how old is old enough, compute the maximum value
of Interval * (NumReports + 1) of all entries in the
apmReportControlTable (the '+ 1' is to allow a reasonable
period of time for the report to be downloaded). Then take the
larger of this value and the age in seconds of the oldest
entry in the current transaction table. If an entry for a
clientID is superseded by another entry whose StartTime is
more than this many seconds ago, then the older entry may be
deleted.""",

when downloading a very short file, a single dropped packet
could double or triple the total response time.

Further, throughput is usually examined for applications that
transfer a lot of data, and when doing so it is helpful to
conceptualize transaction costs that are proportional to the
amount of data separately from those costs that are relatively
fixed (i.e., independent of the amount of data).  For very
short transactions, these fixed transaction costs (handshake,
setup time, authentication, round-trip time) may dominate the
total response time for the transaction, resulting in
throughput measurements that aren't really proportional to the
network's, server's and client's combined data throughput
capability.

This object controls the minimum number of seconds that an
throughput-based transaction must exceed before an exception
can be generated for it. If this object is set to zero, then
all throughput-based transactions are candidates for
exceptions.

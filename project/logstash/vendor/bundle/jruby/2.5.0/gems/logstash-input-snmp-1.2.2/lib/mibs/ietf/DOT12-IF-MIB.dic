training.  One of the following values:

    opened      - Training has completed
                  successfully.
    closed      - MAC has been disabled by
                  setting dot12Commands to
                  'close'.
    opening     - MAC is in training.  Training
                  signals have been received.
    openFailure - Passed 24 error-free packets,
                  but there is a problem, noted
                  in the training configuration
                  bits (dot12LastTrainingConfig).
    linkFailure - Training signals not received,
                  or could not pass 24 error-free
                  packets.
Whenever the dot12Commands object is set to
'close' or ifAdminStatus is set to 'down', the MAC
will go silent, dot12Status will be 'closed', and
ifOperStatus will be 'down'.

When the value of this object is equal to 'closed'
and the dot12Commands object is set to 'open' or
the ifAdminStatus object is set to 'up', training
will be initiated on this interface.  When the
value of this object is not equal to 'closed' and
the dot12Commands object is set to 'reset',
training will be reinitiated on this interface.
Note that sets of some other objects (e.g.
dot12ControlMode) or external events (e.g. MAC
protocol violations) may also cause training to be
reinitiated on this interface.

When training is initiated or reinitiated on an
interface, the end node will send Training_Up to
the master and initially go to the 'linkFailure'
state and ifOperStatus will go to 'down'.
When the master sends back Training_Down,
dot12Status will change to the 'opening' state,
and training packets will be transferred.

After all of the training packets have been
passed, dot12Status will change to 'linkFailure'
if 24 consecutive error-free packets were not
passed, 'opened' if 24 consecutive error-free
packets were passed and the training
configuration bits were OK, or 'openFailure' if
there were 24 consecutive error-free packets, but
there was a problem with the training
configuration bits.

When in the 'openFailure' state, the
dot12LastTrainingConfig object will contain the
configuration bits from the last training
packet which can be examined to determine the
exact reason for the training configuration
failure.

If training did not succeed (dot12Status is
'linkFailure' or 'openFailure), the entire
process will be restarted after
MAC_Retraining_Delay_Timer seconds.

If training does succeed (dot12Status changes to
'opened'), ifOperStatus will change to 'up'.  If
training does not succeed (dot12Status changes to
'linkFailure' or 'openFailure'), ifOperStatus will
remain 'down'.""",

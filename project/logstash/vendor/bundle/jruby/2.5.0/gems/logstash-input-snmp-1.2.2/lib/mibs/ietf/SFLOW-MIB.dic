The following data source types are currently defined:

- ifIndex.<I>
DataSources of this traditional form are called 'port-based'.
Ideally the sampling entity will perform sampling on all flows
originating from or destined to the specified interface.
However, if the switch architecture only permits input or
output sampling then the sampling agent is permitted to only
sample input flows input or output flows.  Each packet must
only be considered once for sampling, irrespective of the
number of ports it will be forwarded to.

Note: Port 0 is used to indicate that all ports on the device
      are represented by a single data source.
      - sFlowPacketSamplingRate applies to all ports on the
        device capable of packet sampling.
      - sFlowCounterSamplingInterval applies to all ports.

- smonVlanDataSource.<V>
A dataSource of this form refers to a 'Packet-based VLAN'
and is called a 'VLAN-based' dataSource.  <V> is the VLAN



ID as defined by the IEEE 802.1Q standard.  The
value is between 1 and 4094 inclusive, and it represents
an 802.1Q VLAN-ID with global scope within a given
bridged domain.
Sampling is performed on all packets received that are part
of the specified VLAN (no matter which port they arrived on).
Each packet will only be considered once for sampling,
irrespective of the number of ports it will be forwarded to.

- entPhysicalEntry.<N>
A dataSource of this form refers to a physical entity within
the agent (e.g., entPhysicalClass = backplane(4)) and is called
an 'entity-based' dataSource.
Sampling is performed on all packets entering the resource (e.g.
If the backplane is being sampled, all packets transmitted onto
the backplane will be considered as single candidates for
sampling irrespective of the number of ports they ultimately
reach).

rate of 0 disables sampling.

The agent is permitted to have minimum and maximum allowable

designer set an upper bound on the overhead associated with
sampling, and a maximum rate may be the result of hardware
restrictions (such as counter size).  In addition not all values

sampling rate (again because of implementation considerations).

When the sampling rate is set the agent is free to adjust the
value so that it lies between the maximum and minimum values

This MIB module obsoletes IPMROUTE-STD-MIB defined by
[RFC2932].  Changes include the following:

o  This MIB module includes support for IPv6 addressing
   and the IPv6 scoped address architecture.  [RFC2932]
   supported only IPv4.

o  This MIB module allows several multicast protocols
   to perform routing on a single interface, where
   [RFC2932] assumed each interface supported at most
   one multicast routing protocol.  Multicast routing
   protocols are now per-route, see
   ipMcastRouteProtocol.




o  This MIB module includes objects that are not
   specific to multicast routing.  It allows management
   of multicast function on systems that do not perform
   routing, whereas [RFC2932] was restricted to
   multicast routing.

o  This MIB module includes a table of Source-Specific
   Multicast (SSM) address ranges to which SSM
   semantics [RFC3569] should be applied.

o  This MIB module includes a table of local
   applications that are receiving multicast data.

o  This MIB module includes a table of multicast scope
   zones.""",

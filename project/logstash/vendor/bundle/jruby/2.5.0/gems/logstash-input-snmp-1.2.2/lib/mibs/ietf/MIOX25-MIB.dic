                """This reports the status of a peer entry.
A value of valid indicates a normal entry
that is in use by the agent.  A value of
underCreation indicates a newly created
entry which isn't yet in use because the
creating management station is still setting
values.

The value of invalid indicates the entry is
no longer in use and the agent is free to
delete the entry at any time.  A management
station is also free to use an entry in the
invalid state.

Entries are created by setting a value of
createRequest.  Only non-existent or invalid
entries can be set to createRequest.  Upon
receiving a valid createRequest, the agent
will create an entry in the underCreation
state.  This object can not be set to a
value of underCreation directly, entries can
only be created by setting a value of
createRequest.  Entries that exist in other
than the invalid state can not be set to
createRequest.

Entries with a value of underCreation are
not used by the system and the management
station can change the values of other
objects in the table entry.  Management
stations should also remember to configure
values in the mioxPeerEncTable with the same
peer index value as this peer entry.

An entry in the underCreation state can be
set to valid or invalid.  Entries in the
underCreation state will stay in that state
until 1) the agent times them out, 2) they
are set to valid, 3) they are set to
invalid.  If an agent notices an entry has
been in the underCreation state for an
abnormally long time, it may decide the
management station has failed and invalidate
the entry.  A prudent agent will understand
that the management station may need to wait
for human input and will allow for that
possibility in its determination of this
abnormally long period.

Once a management station has completed all
fields of an entry, it will set a value of
valid.  This causes the entry to be
activated.

Entries in the valid state may also be set
to makeCall or clearCall to make or clear
X.25 calls to the peer.  After such a set
request the entry will still be in the valid
state.  Setting a value of makeCall causes
the agent to initiate an X.25 call request
to the peer specified by the entry.  Setting
a value of clearCall causes the agent to
initiate clearing one X.25 call present to
the peer.  Each set request will initiate
another call or clear request (up to the
maximum allowed); this means that management
stations that fail to get a response to a
set request should query to see if a call
was in fact placed or cleared before
retrying the request.  Entries not in the
valid state can not be set to makeCall or
clearCall.

The values of makeCall and clearCall provide
for circuit control on devices which perform
Ethernet Bridging using static circuit
assignment without address recognition;
other devices which dynamically place calls
based on destination addresses may reject
such requests.

An agent that (re)creates a new entry
because of a set with createRequest, should
also (re)create a mioxPeerEncTable entry
with a mioxPeerEncIndex of 1, and a
mioxPeerEncType of 204 (hex CC).""",

UDP-Lite endpoints on which a local application is

The address type in this table represents the address

higher-layer abstraction.  For example, an application
using IPv6 'sockets' to communicate via IPv4 between
::ffff:10.0.0.1 and ::ffff:10.0.0.2 would use
InetAddressType ipv4(1).

the representation of an application that completely
specifies both local and remote addresses and ports.  A
listening application is represented in three possible
ways:

1) An application that is willing to accept both IPv4

   udpliteEndpointLocalAddressType of unknown(0) and a
   udpliteEndpointLocalAddress of ''h (a zero-length



   octet-string).

2) An application that is willing to accept only IPv4
   or only IPv6 datagrams is represented by a
   udpliteEndpointLocalAddressType of the appropriate
   address type and a udpliteEndpointLocalAddress of
   '0.0.0.0' or '::' respectively.

3) An application that is listening for datagrams only
   for a specific IP address but from any remote
   system is represented by a
   udpliteEndpointLocalAddressType of the appropriate
   address type, with udpliteEndpointLocalAddress
   specifying the local address.

In all cases where the remote address is a wildcard,
the udpliteEndpointRemoteAddressType is unknown(0),
the udpliteEndpointRemoteAddress is ''h (a zero-length
octet-string), and the udpliteEndpointRemotePort is 0.

If the operating system is demultiplexing UDP-Lite
packets by remote address/port, or if the application
has 'connected' the socket specifying a default remote
address/port, the udpliteEndpointRemote* values should

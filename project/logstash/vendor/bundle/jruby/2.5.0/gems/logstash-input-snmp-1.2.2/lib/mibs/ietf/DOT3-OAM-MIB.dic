            """The MIB module for managing the new Ethernet OAM features
introduced by the Ethernet in the First Mile taskforce (IEEE
802.3ah).  The functionality presented here is based on IEEE
802.3ah [802.3ah], released in October, 2004.  [802.3ah] was
prepared as an addendum to the standing version of IEEE 802.3
[802.3-2002].  Since then, [802.3ah] has been
merged into the base IEEE 802.3 specification in [802.3-2005].

In particular, this MIB focuses on the new OAM functions
introduced in Clause 57 of [802.3ah].  The OAM functionality
of Clause 57 is controlled by new management attributes
introduced in Clause 30 of [802.3ah].  The OAM functions are
not specific to any particular Ethernet physical layer, and
can be generically applied to any Ethernet interface of
[802.3-2002].

An Ethernet OAM protocol data unit is a valid Ethernet frame
with a destination MAC address equal to the reserved MAC
address for Slow Protocols (See 43B of [802.3ah]), a
lengthOrType field equal to the reserved type for Slow
Protocols, and a Slow Protocols subtype equal to that of the
subtype reserved for Ethernet OAM.  OAMPDU is used throughout
this document as an abbreviation for Ethernet OAM protocol
data unit.

The following reference is used throughout this MIB module:

                """At initialization and failure conditions, two OAM entities on



the same full-duplex Ethernet link begin a discovery phase to
determine what OAM capabilities may be used on that link.  The
progress of this initialization is controlled by the OA
sublayer.

This value is always disabled(1) if OAM is disabled on this
interface via the dot3OamAdminState.

If the link has detected a fault and is transmitting OAMPDUs
with a link fault indication, the value is linkFault(2).
Also, if the interface is not operational (ifOperStatus is
not up(1)), linkFault(2) is returned.  Note that the object
ifOperStatus may not be up(1) as a result of link failure or
administrative action (ifAdminState being down(2) or
testing(3)).

The passiveWait(3) state is returned only by OAM entities in
passive mode (dot3OamMode) and reflects the state in which the
OAM entity is waiting to see if the peer device is OA
capable.  The activeSendLocal(4) value is used by active mode
devices (dot3OamMode) and reflects the OAM entity actively
trying to discover whether the peer has OAM capability but has
not yet made that determination.

The state sendLocalAndRemote(5) reflects that the local OA
entity has discovered the peer but has not yet accepted or
rejected the configuration of the peer.  The local device can,
for whatever reason, decide that the peer device is
unacceptable and decline OAM peering.  If the local OAM entity
rejects the peer OAM entity, the state becomes
oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7).  If the OAM peering is allowed
by the local device, the state moves to
sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6).  Note that both the
sendLocalAndRemote(5) and oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7) states
fall within the state SEND_LOCAL_REMOTE of the Discovery state
diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5], with the difference being
whether the local OAM client has actively rejected the peering
or has just not indicated any decision yet.  Whether a peering
decision has been made is indicated via the local flags field
in the OAMPDU (reflected in the aOAMLocalFlagsField of
30.3.6.1.10).

If the remote OAM entity rejects the peering, the state
becomes oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8).  Note that both the
sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6) and oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8)
states fall within the state SEND_LOCAL_REMOTE_OK of the
Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5], with the
difference being whether the remote OAM client has rejected



the peering or has just not yet decided.  This is indicated
via the remote flags field in the OAMPDU (reflected in the
aOAMRemoteFlagsField of 30.3.6.1.11).

When the local OAM entity learns that both it and the remote
OAM entity have accepted the peering, the state moves to
operational(9) corresponding to the SEND_ANY state of the
Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5].

Since Ethernet OAM functions are not designed to work
completely over half-duplex interfaces, the value
nonOperHalfDuplex(10) is returned whenever Ethernet OAM is
enabled (dot3OamAdminState is enabled(1)), but the interface
is in half-duplex operation.""",

passive mode generally waits for the peer to initiate OA

the remote OAM entity in a loopback state, where a passive OA
entity cannot.

The default value of dot3OamMode is dependent on the type of

this system should take on a subservient role to the other

                """The loopback status of the OAM entity.  This status is
determined by a combination of the local parser and
multiplexer states, the remote parser and multiplexer states,
as well as by the actions of the local OAM client.  When
operating in normal mode with no loopback in progress, the
status reads noLoopback(1).

The values initiatingLoopback(2) and terminatingLoopback(4)
can be read or written.  The other values can only be read -
they can never be written.  Writing initiatingLoopback causes
the local OAM entity to start the loopback process with its
peer.  This value can only be written when the status is
noLoopback(1).  Writing the value initiatingLoopback(2) in any
other state has no effect.  When in remoteLoopback(3), writing
terminatingLoopback(4) causes the local OAM entity to initiate
the termination of the loopback state.  Writing
terminatingLoopack(4) in any other state has no effect.

If the OAM client initiates a loopback and has sent a
Loopback OAMPDU and is waiting for a response, where the local
parser and multiplexer states are DISCARD (see [802.3ah,
57.2.11.1]), the status is 'initiatingLoopback'.  In this
case, the local OAM entity has yet to receive any
acknowledgment that the remote OAM entity has received its
loopback command request.




If the local OAM client knows that the remote OAM entity is in
loopback mode (via the remote state information as described
in [802.3ah, 57.2.11.1, 30.3.6.1.15]), the status is
remoteLoopback(3).  If the local OAM client is in the process
of terminating the remote loopback [802.3ah, 57.2.11.3,
30.3.6.1.14] with its local multiplexer and parser states in
DISCARD, the status is terminatingLoopback(4).  If the remote
OAM client has put the local OAM entity in loopback mode as
indicated by its local parser state, the status is
localLoopback(5).

The unknown(6) status indicates that the parser and
multiplexer combination is unexpected.  This status may be
returned if the OAM loopback is in a transition state but
should not persist.

The values of this attribute correspond to the following
values of the local and remote parser and multiplexer states.

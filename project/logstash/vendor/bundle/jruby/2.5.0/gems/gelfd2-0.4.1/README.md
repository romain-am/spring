[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ptqa/gelfd2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ptqa/gelfd2)


This is a fork of gelfd (see https://github.com/lusis/gelfd). Gelf is a standalone implementation of GELF (Graylog2 Extended Log Format). This is used by the graylog2 server as an extended format for handling log messages.

## Rationale
This was originally concieved as a way to provide a graylog2-compatible input for logstash.
